## üåü Inspiration

Our team at Entropy Labs has a rich background with utility NFTs. We've always aimed to answer these questions:

- How do we bring utility NFTs to the general public, including Web 2.0 brands?
- How can we abstract this concept for users and bring mass adoption into the picture?

This desire to bridge the gap between the digital world of NFTs and the real-world interaction of traditional marketing inspired us to create _"stamps!"_.

## üí° What it does

**stamps!** is a unique marketing tool transformed into an engaging game. Brands can place their utility NFTs, which we call "stamps", at various geolocations worldwide. Users then collect these stamps, which come with underlying benefits that they can utilize before expiration. If not interested or unable to utilize the benefits, users can sell their stamps in a secondary market. This not only adds a new dimension to customer-brand interaction but also introduces an additional revenue stream for brands through secondary sales.

## üîß How we used Rollapps

By leveraging RollApps, stamps! gains access to a network of easily deployable and lightning-fast modular blockchains. This enables the platform to efficiently manage the creation, distribution, and exchange of utility NFTs ("stamps") in a secure and scalable manner. Additionally, RollApps provide the flexibility to adapt to future blockchain innovations, ensuring that stamps! remains at the forefront of NFT technology.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges we ran into

**UX Pov :**
We ran into problems when defining the UX because such an experience is fairly new, the combination of NFTS with AR and also with secondary selling. The app needs to be fun and not too tiring for the user to navigate around. The colors used tried to ease the tension but as we move ahead we continue to use jargon they are familiar with and make it a point to make it more fun for them!

**Tech Pov:**
We have created a mobile-first web experience keeping in mind how a web-first experience can help in mass adoption. The website is built using NextJs, it was hard integrating so many moving parts into a Nextjs project. Getting the camera view working on all devices took some debugging.

## üèÜ Accomplishments that we're proud of

Despite the challenges, we successfully created an innovative platform that combines NFTs, AR, geolocation, and secondary selling, all while maintaining a user-friendly interface. We are proud to have transformed a complex concept into a fun, easy-to-use game.

## üîÆ What's next for Stamps

We plan to continue refining the user experience, incorporating user feedback to make the platform more engaging. Additionally, we plan to introduce physical versions of the **PASSPORT**, enabling users to carry their collection and redeem their benefits in physical stores.
